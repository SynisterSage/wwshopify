**Date**: December 1, 2025
**Participants**: Lex Ferguson (Developer), Friend (Owner)
**Status**: MVP Planning

## Product Strategy & Features

### Homepage
- **Layout**: Simple, easy to navigate
- **Components**:
  - Hero section with CTA
  - Hot/featured products showcase
  - Advertisements/deals section
  - Sales insights/analytics
- **Vibe**: Keep it simple, no need to go all out initially

### Products Page
- **Main Feature**: "Shop by Category/Brand" filter at the top
- **Additional Filters**: Multiple filtering options (price, type, tags, etc.)
- **Structure**: One main website with brand/category sections
- **Future Enhancement**: Separate stores/sections for each brand (down the line)

### Product Inventory Management
- **Strategy**: Owner will constantly add/remove products
- **Approach**: Dynamic inventory management via Shopify admin
- **No manually coded product lists**

### Checkout & Authentication
- **Guest Checkout**: NO required user profiles
- **Simple Flow**: Input information → Buy → Done
- **No Account Creation**: Not needed for MVP
- **Benefits**: 10x easier to implement, lower friction for customers
- **Future**: If store gets "surprisingly populated", add profile + rewards system

## Timeline Estimates

- **MVP**: ~4 days
- **Full Production**: ~1 week
